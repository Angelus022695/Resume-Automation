# Resume Automation

Automation for your **Resume**, **Cover Letter**, a **cold contact message** on LinkedIn, and a **connection message**.

This tool simplifies the application process by generating tailored documents and messages in just a few steps.

### üöÄ How It Works:

- Upload a template for your **resume** and **cover letter**.  
  The template stays loaded until you exit the application.
  
- Enter:
  - The **job position title**
  - The **company name**
  - The **title and last name of the person** you want to contact (e.g., Mr. Bandari, Ms. Chen)

- Use the file picker buttons to select your resume and cover letter templates via your folder system.

- Choose where you'd like the **completed new Resume and Cover Letter** to be saved.

- After clicking **"Generate Files + Messages"**, the **cold contact message** and **connection message** will be displayed at the bottom of the screen for copy-pasting.

### üß© Template Placeholder Guide

To enable dynamic replacement, your resume and cover letter templates must include the following **placeholders** exactly as shown:

| Placeholder          | Description                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `[[JOB_TITLE]]`       | The title of the position you're applying for |
| `[[COMPANY_NAME]]`    | The name of the company                    |
| `[[CONTACT_TITLE]]`   | The contact‚Äôs title (e.g., Mr, Ms, Dr)     |
| `[[LAST_NAME]]`       | The contact‚Äôs last name                   |

üîÅ These values will automatically be replaced when you run the program.  
üí° Make sure the placeholders are **spelled exactly** as shown, including the square brackets (`[[ ]]`).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Add Your Own Personal Information

This project includes prewritten **cold contact** and **connection messages**, along with placeholder-based **resume and cover letter templates**, as part of its automation features.

All personal information has already been **removed** from the provided files.

To ensure the tool works correctly, please follow these steps:

- ‚úçÔ∏è **Insert your own information** (e.g., name, email, LinkedIn URL) into the message and document templates.
- ‚ùó These files will not work out of the box until you customize them with your own data.
- ‚úÖ **Paste your personalized messages directly into the `*text*` fields**, and make sure your resume and cover letter templates include the appropriate placeholders listed above.

If you skip this step, your output may:
- Look generic or incomplete
- Include missing or incorrect contact details
- Fail to reflect your professional experience and voice

### üß© Coming Soon: Sanitized Starter Templates

I will be uploading **sanitized versions of the resume, cover letter, cold outreach, and connection message templates** in a future update.

These will help users who struggle to write their own application materials or communication messages from scratch.
